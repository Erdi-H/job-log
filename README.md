# Job Log

## Description

Job Log is a personal web app for organizing and managing job applications. It lets easily add, update, and track the jobs you applied to.
Its currently designed to only run on your local machine and was built for fun.

My future plans are to add some lightweight NLP features, so you can paste raw job postings and have the data automatically extracted.

## Tools

Frontend: Angular.js

Backend: Node.js + Express

Database: SQLite

## Installation

Anyone is free to use code from this repo.

- Clone repo
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Erdi-H/job-log.git
  ```

## TODO

- [ ] finish frontend
- [ ] use NLP tool like spaCy so I can paste in job listings and have the data autofill
- [ ] add some forms of analytics (#jobs applied, )
